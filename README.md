## 🌟 Features

- Identification of various distribution patterns of samples in the latent space based on neighborhood characteristics
- A model-agnostic latent space analysis of neural networks, focusing on samples from a single class
- A method for straightforwardly comparing different classes and understanding how samples from various classes are distributed in the learned latent space
